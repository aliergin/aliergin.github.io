a larger and more mobile set of devices, including our cars, portable
phones,
and sensing nodes, a major</small><small> challenge lies i</small><small>n
the integration of
location information into the network architecture. There are several
key challenges in defining such a location-aware architecture. First,
the architecture should include a distributed location service that can
track and answer queries about the current positions of billions of
moving objects. Because of frequent position changes the load on this
service will be higher than on the current domain name system. Second,
the architecture must cope with translations between different
representations of location and accuracy information. Third, the
architecture must be suitable for hierarchical network structures and
allow routing between wired and wireless network components. </small><small>
Examination of cross-layer designs
that support the use of location information at different (traditional)
network
layers is one of the key objectives of this project. I have been
participating in this project as a research assistant, investigating
the kinds of support we need from future Internet for better wireless
experience.</small><small></small>

Even today, small laptop platforms with six or more digital
communication radios (such as WLAN, WiMAX, GSM, UWB, GPS, Bluetooth,
DTV) are not uncommon. Sharing the same spectrum resources or not,
concurrent use of these radios create varying degrees of adverse
effects on each others performance, some noticeable by the end-user.
Objective of the project was first to evaluate and measure common
coexistence scenarios using real platforms under typical workloads to
find out degree of problem severity. Then several solutions, including
a software scheduling for coexistence coordination, have been
investigated for orchestrating multiple-radios on our future
wireless-capable devices.</small></td>

this project, we investigate various forms of vehicle-to-infrastructure

potential gains from optimizations such as fast signaling, diversity,
directionality and location awareness. We have been developing a
vehicular networking testbed as an extension to ORBIT testbed outdoor
infrastructure. This extension is composed of a number of vehicular
mobile nodes and fixed-location nodes with proper outdoor antennas to
provide us with an opportunity to test our designs in a real-world
environment. Our&nbsp;setup currently has one trunk-installed ORBIT
outdoor node in a passenger car and five modular seat-tray-installed
outdoor nodes. Fixed-location nodes are operational at five different
places with ten nodes in ORBIT facility at NJ Tech Centre, North
Brunswick and three locations in Rutgers University Busch Campus at
Piscataway.</span></small><br><small><span style="font-family: Verdana;"></span></small></div><small><span style="font-family: Verdana;"></span></small></td>

of high density wireless LANs, beyond the overly simplistic 'more
clients have to mean degraded system performance' point of view. We
have been carrying out ORBIT testbed experiments with up to 350
wireless stations and up to 15 access points to break down the effects
of arrival patterns, MAC parameters, transport protocols, workload type
etc.</span></small></td></tr><tr>

applications of packet-probing method of wired networks to wireless
networks for this purpose. Our prototype system on ORBIT testbed showed
promising results for better wireless resource management that is key
