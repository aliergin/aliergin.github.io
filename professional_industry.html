<td><small>My first hands-on experience with
industry
dates back to my childhood :) I worked for my dad's company during the
summertime,
doing various things from soldering PCBs, to phone switching equipment
installation. However it wasn't until I turned thirteen that I started
getting paid for my work :) <br>
<br>
Apart from some part-time work, my next industry experience was with <a href="http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/tr/">Alcatel-Lucent,
Turkey</a> (which was </small><small>Alcatel Teleta&#351;
back then</small><small>)
in 1999. I started working there for my undergrad project as an intern
and then signed a contract after graduation to transfer know-how for
the GSM payphone design and implementation I worked on with a couple of
my classmates.<br>
<br>During my undergrad years and a couple more after graduation
(1997-2002), I was affiliated with my own IT start-up, founded&nbsp;with
my classmate At&#305;f Alipa&#351;ao&#287;lu, A ve A Bilgisayar Ltd. (literally, A and
A Computers Limited). I would summarize our company's interests back
then as 'everything computer-related',&nbsp;that could let it survive.
We frequently dealt with OEM PC sales and support. After we sold the
company,&nbsp;another A ve A (more like '<a href="http://www.avea.com.tr">avea</a>') happened to come to life out of a merger as a premium GSM operator.<br><br>Attracted
to pursuing a Masters degree, I was drawn to scholastic communities,
serving as a teaching (and research at times) assistant at <a href="http://www.yeditepe.edu.tr/">Yeditepe University</a>, <a href="http://cse.yeditepe.edu.tr/">Computer Engineering Department</a>, for five years. That attraction has not ceased after getting a Masters, apparently, I now do work towards a PhD degree in <a href="http://www.winlab.rutgers.edu">WINLAB</a>, <a href="http://www.ece.rutgers.edu/">Electrical and Computer Engineering Department</a>, at <a href="http://www.rutgers.edu">Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey</a>.<br><br>Although I haven't resumed working at a full-time position in the industry, I had the opportunity to work for the <a href="http://www.intel.com/technology/comms/ctl/">Communication Technology Labs</a> at <a href="http://www.intel.com/">Intel Corp</a>.
for two summers (Santa Clara, CA, and Hillsboro, OR) in 2005 and 2006.
I've had hands-on experience with WiFi, UWB, WiMAX and multi-radio
coexistence issues in general. Also, WINLAB's industry sponsorship
program gave me the chance to work on small projects for <a href="http://www.research.panasonic.com">Panasonic Corp.</a> (PSDU of USA), <a href="http://www.intel.com">Intel Corp.</a> (CTL), and <a href="http://www.toyota-itc.com/">Toyota ITC</a>. <br>
